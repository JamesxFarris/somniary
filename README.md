## Description
---
Here at the Somniary team, we believe that dreams hold immense value, not only as personal experiences but also as stories meant to be shared. In our quest to find a convenient way to record and recall our dreams, we created The Dreamspace.
<br>
<br>
Your Dreamspace is the home for all your dreams, both public and private. Here, you can revisit recent dreams and delve into the depths of distant memories. It is here that you can document your dreams in your personal journal and, should you desire, share them with the Dreamspace Collective.
<br>
<br>
The Dreamspace Collective is a gathering of wandering dreams from all around the world, inspiring and entertaining our Dreamers. It is a realm of chaos and beauty, offering unfiltered and unregulated input. Enter at your own risk.
